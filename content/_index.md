title: "Geoffrey's on Software Development"
---
Software Development gives us the opportunities to live in a more accessible world.
It gives us the abilities to make things that can enhance our lives. For example, we can create time and effort saving devices.

Further, Software Development brings people together.
It is in the sharing of experiences, ideas, efforts, and knowledge that the communities behind Software Development continue.

As a Senior Software Developer with an MSc in Software Engineering, on this website, I share with you my passions for Software Development, Software Integrations, IoT (Internet of Things), and Web Development.
On these topics, I am sure you will find resources that will interest you. 

From time to time I also post about other topics.
I like playing tennis, keeping fit, cooking and family life.

You are very welcome to send me positive feedback and suggestions. 
I very much want to keep my website engaging for you.
