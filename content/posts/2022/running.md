When I switched from my Fitbit Charge 4 (a basic GPS tracker) to my Garmin Forerunner 245 (a running focused GPS tracker), 
a whole new world of guided aerobic base training opened. However, I just turned the suggestions off and forgot about it. 
Basically, I always run as fast as I can most of the time and the idea of running slowly was alain to me. 

Backround...


When I eventurally tried it, I found I managed a 10km for foot run. I had no pain the next day. Also, seven killomitors in
I decided to try lifting my neas up high. I am sure that will benifit my faster runs.
