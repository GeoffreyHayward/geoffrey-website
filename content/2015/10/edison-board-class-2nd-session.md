In last week's 2nd session of the Edison board class a lot of the time was spent making sure everyone was set-up ready to start making stuff. We were also introduced to the Grove Starter Kit Plus for the Intel IoT Edison Board.

The Grove Starter Kit Plus for the Edison Board is an interesting collection of sensors. The box includes many sensors, many LEDs, a buzzer, the base shield for Arduino and a stepper motor. Here is the full list of what's in the box:

* Base Shield v2
* Grove LCD RGB Backlight
* Grove Buzzer
* Grove Sound Sensor
* Grove Touch Sensor
* Grove Temperature
* Grove Light Sensor
* Grove Rotary Angle Sensor
* Grove Button
* Grove LED Socket with 3mm Red LED
* Grove LED Socket with 3mm Green LED
* Grove LED Socket with 3mm Blue LED
* Grove 3-Axis Digital Accelerometer(Â±1.5g)
* Grove Piezo Vibration Sensor
* micro-USB cable

Our homework; get something working with the starter kit. I thought I would have a play with the LCD RGB backlight screen and the temperature sensor. This is what I made:

The code that I wrote for this is:

```javascript
var jsUpmI2cLcd  = require ('jsupm_i2clcd');
var groveSensor = require('jsupm_grove');

var lcd = new jsUpmI2cLcd.Jhd1313m1(6, 0x3E, 0x62); // Initialize the LCD
var temp = new groveSensor.GroveTemp(0);
 
function doTemperature(){
    var value = temp.value();
    doPrint(value);
    doColour(value);
}

function doPrint(value){
    lcd.clear();
    lcd.setCursor(0,0); 
    lcd.write("Temperature");
    lcd.setCursor(1,0);
    lcd.write(value.toPrecision(2) + "C");
}

function doColour(value){
    if(value <= 17){
           lcd.setColor(0, 0, 250);    
    }
    if(value > 17 && value < 25){
           lcd.setColor(0, 225, 0);    
    }
    if(value >= 25){
           lcd.setColor(225, 0, 0);    
    }
}

lcd.setCursor(0,0); 
lcd.write("Loading");
setInterval( doTemperature, 3000);
```

I found the [Seeed Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/) to be a very good resource for getting going with the sensor and LED RBG screen.</p>
<p>That's it for this week. The next session is tomorrow. I will have an update soon.</p>
