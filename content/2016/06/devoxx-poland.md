I am looking forward to attending Devoxx Poland 2016; I enjoyed Devoxx Poland last year very much. As well as visiting Krakow.

This year I am looking forward to talks on: Java 9 Flow API; Angular 2; Microservices; lambdas; and many other topics. But, worryingly there does not seem to be a single talk with "Java EE" in the title. Like last year Devoxx Poland has attracted many great speakers.

Also, the food last year was delicious, so I hoping for the same this year.
