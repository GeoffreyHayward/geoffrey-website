Out of the stone age (I moved my website's platform to Hugo) and up and running again (writing posts and literally 
running too). I started working on my Hugo managed new website two years ago, but dreaded the task of moving my content over. 
This dreaded task became a kind of became a mental blocker. It stopped me writhing anything new. But this year's domain 
renewal prompted me to just do it. 

Join me in a short history of my website and some technical notes about Hugo and hosting it on CloudFlaer's Pages for free
on a edge served CDN.
